# Crystal Collector Game

This game was a homework submission for the Coding Bootcamp from University of Sydney and Trilogy Education Services.

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive game where the HTML is dynamically updated using the jQuery library.

## How to Play
* A random number (between 19 - 120) is generated on the page
* Four chrystals are adisplayed, each with a different hidden value (between 1 - 12)
* Each time the player clicks on a chrystal that hidden value is added to their total score
* If the player matches their score to the random number, they win the game!
* When the game is restarted, a new random number and new chrystal values are assigned
* Wins and losses will be counted

## Built With
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* jQuery Library
